## Final Project: Twitter Bot Detection
Project: https://github.com/eumarassis/Harvard-s109-TwitterBotDetection

In a team of four, we assembled and trained a variety of classification algorithms (KNN, LogReg, AdaBoost, Random Forest, etc) on a large set of prelabeled twitter data (bots, non-bots). The Random Forest classifier achieved 80% accuracy on the testing data.

## Problem Sets


### Pset 1

#### Data Mining/Scraping 

This assignment utilized request/get libraries, and later on beatifulsoup, to scrape IMDb data. 

### Pset 2

#### Linear and k-NN Regression

This assignment explored k-nearest neighbor and linear regression methods for predicting quantitative variables. Regression models were built to predict the number of taxi pickups in NYC at any given time of the day. This project could be used by taxicab drivers to predict their earnings, and city officials to predict traffic.


### Pset 3

#### Multiple Linear Regression, Subset Selection, Polynomial Regression

This assignment explored another group of prediction methodologies to forecast bike sharing usage.
